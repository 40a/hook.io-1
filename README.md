## Hosting for Webhooks and Transform Streams

### Incredibly simple. Free to try.

To start using hook.io visit the website at [http://hook.io](http://hook.io). Here you will find many examples and documentation on how to use hook.io

## Creating new Hooks

It's very simple. Go to [http://hook.io](http://hook.io)

## Support

If you run into an issue, have a question, or have feedback with using hook.io you can open up a Github Issue by [clicking here](http://github.com/bigcompany/hook.io/issues/new)

## Adding new NPM Modules to hook.io

The fastest way to get an additional NPM module added to the hook.io platform is to open up a Pull Request modifying [this file](http://github.com/bigcompany/hook.io/blob/master/modules/modules.js).

If your module requires additional dependencies outside of what NPM can install, you can create a custom build script in [this folder](http://github.com/bigcompany/hook.io/master/modules/builds/). The hosting environment for hook.io is `Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS`. Bash scripts are recommended.

## Source Code

Soon, the source code that runs the live [hook.io](http://hook.io) site will be open-sourced so that you can run your own private hook.io servers!

It's important for us that the experience of setting up a local server is as seamless as using http://hook.io

Once our private hook.io reaches this level of completeness we will release it.
