#!/usr/local/bin/scheme

;;; It may look like this doesn't do anything yet...
;;; ...but for some reason the scheme binary is just magically working without any changes
;;;
;;; I am assuming this is because the -c argument is being picked up by scheme and automatically evaluating the code
;;; This behavior is *ok* for now, but will be changed in the future to use -e and -s args
